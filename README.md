# Procedural Maze Generation in Unity (UNFINISHED)

## Overview
This project right now is a procedural maze generator built in Unity. It creates a labyrinth with branching paths and loops, allowing players to explore and get lost in the maze. The maze is generated using a modified version of the depth-first search algorithm, which ensures a more complex and interconnected layout.

## Features
- **Procedural Generation**: The maze is generated algorithmically, ensuring a unique layout every time.
- **Branching Paths**: The maze includes multiple paths and loops, making it more challenging and interesting to navigate.
- **Customizable Rules**: Define rules for room placement and spawning probabilities to create different types of mazes.
- **Dynamic Room Updates**: Rooms are dynamically updated to reflect the maze's structure, with walls and doors being activated or deactivated based on the maze's layout.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Open the project in Unity (version 2020.3 or later recommended).
3. Navigate to the `Scenes` folder and open the `Example`.
4. Press `Play` to generate and explore the maze.
